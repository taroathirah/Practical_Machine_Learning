First of all thank you for opening this file
Im having a hard time to publish my html file tho ive followed the tutorial. It seems so hard to publish the compiled html here. 
therefore, you will see a lot of related stuff (folders and files) in this repo.

So, let say you wanna see the rmd file, u can either check the index.rmd or Project Practical Machine Learning.Rmd

As for the html, im suggesting you to check the html version here: http://taroathirah.github.io/Practical_Machine_Learning/


Thanks for reading
