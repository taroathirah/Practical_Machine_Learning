First of all thank you for opening this file
Im having a hard time to publish my html file tho ive followed the tutorial 
(link: https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-ghPagesSetup.md). 

It seems so hard to publish the compiled html here. 
therefore, you will see a lot of related stuff (folders and files) in this repo.

>> So, let say you wanna see the rmd file, u can either check the index.rmd or Project Practical Machine Learning.Rmd

>> As for the html, im suggesting you to check the html version here: (Link: http://taroathirah.github.io/Practical_Machine_Learning/)  
OR published at rpubs publication (link: http://rpubs.com/taroathirah/Project_PML) as im not sure why my index.html doesnt want 
to publish the compiled html.

Kindly comment at the evaluation page if you had the idea.


Thanks!
